\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item voting systems is a central topic of computational social choice
\item one typical question is how to bribe certain users to achieve a desirable outcome
\item however, most research work focus on either worst case analysis (i.e., computational complexity) or economical incentives
\item they assume that they know the outcome of the original voters
\item this is not always the case: see elections, etc
\item we tackle the problem from a stochastic perspective
\item we focus on 2 questions: (i) given fixed number of bribed voters, we analyse the probability of success in different manipulation algorithms; and (ii) what is the number of bribed voters is needed in order to guarantee a certain probability of success in different manipulation algorithms
\end{enumerate}
