\section{Numerical Evaluation}
\label{section:num_results}

\noindent
\textbf{TODO list:}
\begin{itemize}
\item generate N votes based on distribution $D$ - we can use the distribution from Bouttelier et al.'s paper 
\item run with different manipulation algorithms: with fixed bribed votes - with fixed probability 
\end{itemize}
